            <strong>Profile pictures</strong> must be clear headshot images of

          <strong>Cover pictures</strong> can increase engagement. You can
          select one from our library or choose a good-quality image with the
          best resolution possible from your device.

        <li>
          <strong>Usernames</strong> are your screen names. Any activity youâ€™d
          be participating in Hivepath will be recorded under your username. If
          your username is taken, consider using your{" "}
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>nicknames</span> or{" "}
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "500" }}>interchanging </span> 
          letters that are similar to your name. This way the possibilities are
          nearly endless!
